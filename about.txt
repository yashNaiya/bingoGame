we all have sometimes in our student lives have played bingo in boring class.
bingo is among one of the games which are easy to understand and play.

it is a multi-player game.in it each player draws his/her 5x5 grid and fill it up with numbers between 1 to 25.
After that each player then by their turn tells one number which gets erased by every player,
this continues untill one of the player wins.

in bingo winner is the one who simply has 5 straight or horizontal lines complitley erased,every time player has turn to
tell number he/she tells a number which will make it easier for them to complete their 5 lines erased.
